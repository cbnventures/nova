# @cbnventures/nova

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- Added a `Logger.dev` feature where a developer can use that in replacement of `console.log`.
- Added custom ESLint rules to be exported for usage (starting with the `no-logger-dev` rule).
- `Logger.customize` now has the ability for developer to declare the type and purpose of logging (in addition to the function name).

### Patch Changes

- Running ESLint during builds will now treat warnings as errors (for `@cbnventures/nova` package).
- Added tests (to test for the `discoverPathsWithFile`).

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- Renamed "Foundation Nova" to "Nova".
- Removed `freeze-deps` and `sync-pkg-mgr` recipe subcommands in favor of `sync-metadata` and `sync-versions` recipe subcommands.
- Added `workspaces` support for Nova config to better manage apps/packages inside the monorepo.

### Patch Changes

- Fixed `engines.node` to be consistent with `^22` (The latest LTS version for Node.js).
- Made a minor change to prefer shorthand properties (where key value pairs are the same visually).
- Made a minor change to prefer template literals (instead of "string + concatenation").
- Grouped type declaration files to its "types" respective folders.
- Fixed logo SVG to include a newline at end of the file.
- Refactored code that used CRLF to now use LF for modern reasons.
- Changed "DiscoverPackageJsons" to a more versatile "DiscoverPathsWithFile" internal utility function.
- Refactored the "initialize" command to remove garbage code generated by AI.
- Changed "HttpUrlField" type to accept "generic" instead of "fundSources" (because too vague).

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- Removed the `inspect` CLI command now that we decided not to wrap ESLint/TypeScript print-config.

### Patch Changes

- Updated the CLI "CURRENTLY RUNNING:" text to also include the base command used (`nova`) for better debugging purposes.
- Renamed `CLIInitialize` and `CLIVersion` to their sub-folder `CLIUtility*` variants.
- Separated toolkit types into their own directory to prevent prefix collision.
- Rename `sync-pkg-manager` to `sync-pkg-mgr` to shorten already long commands, in addition to adding a "one-letter per word" alias.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- Prevent usage of `console` completely. Either use the `Logger` toolkit battery or write to the process directly. This is to prevent over-reliance of `console.log`.
- Align multi-line log payloads with prefix-aware indentation.
- Default production-browser logs to warn/error while keeping backend defaults.

### Patch Changes

- Refreshed docs and tooling stacks by bumping Docusaurus, React, TypeScript, ESLint, and related plugins/libs to their latest releases.
- Add a single-character ellipsis when CLI header text is truncated to fit the specified width.
- Add `CLIHeader` to the toolkit barrel export so consumers can import it via `@cbnventures/nova/toolkit`.
