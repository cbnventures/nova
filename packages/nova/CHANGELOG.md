# @cbnventures/nova

## 0.13.0 (2026-02-27)

### UPDATED
- Broadened `engines.node` from `^22` to `^20 || ^22 || ^24` to support all active Node.js LTS versions.
- `skipLibCheck` will now be set to `false` for `dx-strict.json` TSConfig presets. To suppress type checks outside of project files, use the `nova utility type-check` command instead.
- Enabled `allowSyntheticDefaultImports` in the `dx-strict.json` TSConfig preset.
- Renamed item pretty name exports for consistency (e.g. `itemBrandPrettyNames` to `itemPrettyNamesBrand`).
- Renamed `HttpUrlField` to `UrlProtocol` to better distinguish repository and generic URLs.
- Replaced validation in favor for normalization in the "nova utility initialize" command.
- Changed the CLI command `sync-metadata` to `sync-packages` to represent a broader view of `package.json` syncing.
- Updated project scaffolding files, GitHub issue templates, and CI/CD workflows.
- Removed padding from logs that aren't directly related to UI (e.g., limit padding for prompts only).
- Replaced inline `no-restricted-syntax` configs in `dx-code-style` and `lang-mdx` presets with dedicated ESLint rules.
- Stricter `ImportDeclaration` formatting in `dx-code-style` preset.

### FIXED
- Fixed an issue where the `nova utility initialize` command would crash because the existing workspace does not exist in the `nova.config.json` file.
- Made types clearer for `ItemAllowedPoliciesByRole` because it was using `Exclude` instead of `Extract`.
- Fixed documentation typos, grammar, and voice consistency across CLI, toolkit, and quickstart pages.

### ADDED
- Added version range regex patterns (`PATTERN_DIGITS`, `PATTERN_RANGE_GREATER_EQUAL_MAJOR`, `PATTERN_RANGE_MAJOR`) for engine constraint parsing.
- Added `nova utility changelog` command with `record` and `release` subcommands for managing release notes.
- Added `nova utility type-check` command. Widened `CLIExecuteCommandOptions` to `Partial<Options>`.
- Added `nova recipe sync-lts-engines` command for syncing `engines.node` to the current Node.js LTS constraint.
- Added `no-regex-literals`, `no-regex-literal-flags`, and `no-raw-text-in-code` ESLint rules.
- Added an `interactive` option to the CLIHeader battery for plain-text output in non-TTY environments.
- Added `nova recipe pin-versions` command for stripping range prefixes from dependency versions.
- Added a "switch-case-blocks" ESLint rule for enforcing blocks inside switch cases.
- Added an "emails" section into Nova configuration (support for additional canonical contact methods).
- Added runtime API modules for SPDX license validation and Node.js LTS version detection.
- Added a `--replace-file` option for the CLI `nova utility initialize` command.
- Added `pinVersions` and `syncLtsEngines` workspace options to the Nova configuration.
- Added a `template` role with `freezable` policy for those who would like to create templates/examples in their monorepo.
- Added a "syncProperties" option for each workspace in the Nova configuration.
- Added shared utilities `isPlainObject`, `isProjectRoot`, `loadWorkspaceManifests`, and `saveWorkspaceManifest` for recipe commands.
- Added a shared utility `isFileIdentical` for checking identical files before editing them.
- Added a shared utility `renameFileWithDate` for commands that make file modifications.

### REMOVED
- Removed the `sync-versions` CLI command. Its `packageManager` validation is now part of `sync-packages`.

## 0.12.0 (2025-11-02)

### UPDATED
- `Logger.customize` now has the ability for developer to declare the type and purpose of logging (in addition to the function name).
- Running ESLint during builds will now treat warnings as errors (for `@cbnventures/nova` package).

### ADDED
- Added a `Logger.dev` feature where a developer can use that in replacement of `console.log`.
- Added custom ESLint rules to be exported for usage (starting with the `no-logger-dev` rule).
- Added tests (to test for the `discoverPathsWithFile`).

## 0.11.0 (2025-10-30)

### UPDATED
- Renamed "Foundation Nova" to "Nova".
- Removed `freeze-deps` and `sync-pkg-mgr` recipe subcommands in favor of `sync-metadata` and `sync-versions` recipe subcommands.
- Made a minor change to prefer shorthand properties (where key value pairs are the same visually).
- Made a minor change to prefer template literals (instead of "string + concatenation").
- Grouped type declaration files to its "types" respective folders.
- Refactored code that used CRLF to now use LF for modern reasons.
- Changed "DiscoverPackageJsons" to a more versatile "DiscoverPathsWithFile" internal utility function.
- Refactored the "initialize" command to remove garbage code generated by AI.
- Changed "HttpUrlField" type to accept "generic" instead of "fundSources" (because too vague).

### FIXED
- Fixed `engines.node` to be consistent with `^22` (The latest LTS version for Node.js).
- Fixed logo SVG to include a newline at end of the file.

### ADDED
- Added `workspaces` support for Nova config to better manage apps/packages inside the monorepo.

## 0.10.0 (2025-10-26)

### UPDATED
- Updated the CLI "CURRENTLY RUNNING:" text to also include the base command used (`nova`) for better debugging purposes.
- Renamed `CLIInitialize` and `CLIVersion` to their sub-folder `CLIUtility*` variants.
- Separated toolkit types into their own directory to prevent prefix collision.
- Renamed `sync-pkg-manager` to `sync-pkg-mgr` to shorten already long commands, in addition to adding a "one-letter per word" alias.

### REMOVED
- Removed the `inspect` CLI command now that we decided not to wrap ESLint/TypeScript print-config.

## 0.9.0 (2025-10-24)

### UPDATED
- Prevent usage of `console` completely. Either use the `Logger` toolkit battery or write to the process directly. This is to prevent over-reliance of `console.log`.
- Align multi-line log payloads with prefix-aware indentation.
- Default production-browser logs to warn/error while keeping backend defaults.
- Refreshed docs and tooling stacks by bumping Docusaurus, React, TypeScript, ESLint, and related plugins/libs to their latest releases.

### ADDED
- Added a single-character ellipsis when CLI header text is truncated to fit the specified width.
- Added `CLIHeader` to the toolkit barrel export so consumers can import it via `@cbnventures/nova/toolkit`.
