Generate or update the Nova config file with an interactive wizard that guides you through each step and saves when you confirm.

## Summary

The `initialize` command scaffolds and maintains the [`nova.config.json`](/docs/quickstart/terminology#nova-concepts) file by opening a guided flow across project metadata, key entities, and canonical URLs.

Existing values populate each prompt so you can edit an accurate snapshot and only persist changes when you confirm them.

## Why Use This Command?

- The wizard writes the JSON with only the fields you confirm, no extra cleanup required.
- The wizard lists each field, explains what each field is for, and guides you to fill known values.
- Avoid typos and mismatched formats with built-in validation for slugs, emails, and URLs.
- **Dry run** lets you walk through the questions without touching the config file until you're ready.

## Use Cases

- **Onboarding** — Create the first `nova.config.json` for a new or migrated repository.
- **Metadata refresh** — Keep project descriptions, entities, and canonical URLs in sync after ownership changes.
- **Normalization** — Clean up manually edited entries without hunting for typos in raw JSON.
- **Generator support** — Feed consistent metadata to Nova generators so docs, README files, and release notes stay accurate.

## Requirements

- **Node.js runtime** — Use any Node.js [LTS](/docs/quickstart/terminology#fundamentals) release with either the installed `nova` [CLI](/docs/quickstart/terminology#fundamentals) or `npx`.
- **Project root** — Run the command from the directory containing the top-level `package.json` ([monorepo](/docs/quickstart/terminology#git-and-workflow) root included).
- **Interactive terminal** — The session needs to support interactive prompts for the wizard to function.

## Usage

You can run this command in two ways:

<Tabs groupId="install-state">
  <TabItem value="nova" label="nova (installed)" default>

    ```bash
    # Original
    nova utility initialize

    # Shorthand
    nova util init
    ```

    **Note:** If Nova is installed **only locally** (inside a project), the command will work **only within that project's directory**. See the [npm docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/configuring-npm/folders) for details.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npx" label="npx (no install)">

    ```bash
    # Original
    npx --yes @cbnventures/nova@latest utility initialize

    # Shorthand
    npx --yes @cbnventures/nova@latest util init
    ```

    **Note:** If you prefer the shorter `nova` command, see the [Setup and Configure](/docs/quickstart/setup) guide for installation instructions.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Options

| Flag                 | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-d, --dry-run`      | Preview the entire wizard without writing `nova.config.json` to disk.       |
| `-r, --replace-file` | Overwrite the existing `nova.config.json` instead of creating a dated copy. |

## Flow Overview

The command loops until you choose **Save & Exit** or **Cancel**. You can edit any category multiple times during the same run.

:::tip Editing an existing config?
Existing values are pre-filled in each prompt. Press **Enter** to keep a value, type a new value to replace it, or enter a single space to clear that field.
:::

### Project

- **Purpose**: Edit project display name, slug, short/long descriptions, and keywords in one guided step.
- **Nice to know**: Slug updates propagate to [workspace](/docs/quickstart/terminology#nova-concepts) names for roles that depend on it (`project`, `docs`, `config`, `app`, `tool`) to keep names consistent.
- **Things to watch**: Slug allows only letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores up to 214 characters; keywords are validated per item (50 characters max).

### Entities

- **Purpose**: Manage project-related people and organizations with name, email, URL, and roles in a single flow.
- **Nice to know**: Roles are chosen from the allowed set (author, contributor, supporter) so you don't have to remember labels.
- **Things to watch**: Emails must be valid (contain `@` and a domain); URLs must be valid `http://` or `https://` before they're saved.

### Emails

- **Purpose**: Capture a canonical contact for issues/support so tools and metadata can reference a single address.
- **Nice to know**: Single email field today, kept simple for quick updates.
- **Things to watch**: Only valid addresses persist; blanks remove the stored email.

### URLs

- **Purpose**: Configure canonical links with validation/normalization before persisting: homepage, repository, bugs, license, logo, docs, github, npm, and funding.
- **Nice to know**: Repository accepts `git:`, `git+https:`, `git+ssh:`, `git+http:` plus `http://`, `https://`; all other URLs are `http://`, `https://` only.
- **Things to watch**: Funding sources are entered comma-separated and saved as a list after validation.

### Workspaces

- **Purpose**: List detected workspaces (`package.json`) and edit each with role/policy in one place.
- **Nice to know**: Roles (project, config, docs, app, package, tool, template) and policies ([freezable](/docs/quickstart/terminology#nova-concepts), [trackable](/docs/quickstart/terminology#nova-concepts), [distributable](/docs/quickstart/terminology#nova-concepts)) are constrained to allowed combinations so you don't accidentally pick an invalid pairing.
- **Things to watch**: Naming rules enforced by role (config/app/tool require the project-slug prefix when set); distributable workspaces can opt into syncing selected metadata fields.

## Saving and Canceling

- Choosing **Save & Exit** writes to a file called `nova.config.json`.
- Choosing **Cancel** exits immediately without persisting changes and prints a debug log.

    }
  }
```

## Troubleshooting

- **"Must be run inside the project root directory."** — Verify you execute the command where the project root `package.json` resides. App or package folders inside monorepos are not allowed.
- **Validation loops keep reappearing.** — Fix the highlighted email or URL before continuing. To drop the value, enter a single space and press **Enter**.
- **No file was created.** — Confirm that `nova.config.json` is writable and that `--dry-run` was not passed or **Cancel** was not chosen.
